# ðŸŽµ Quantum Music Engine

**Turn EEG brainwave data into generative music using quantum-inspired logic.**  
This project collapses neural data states into musical melodies, creating sound from thought patterns. Think: a brainwave-to-MIDI machine.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- EEG signals (AF3 and eye state) are interpreted as **quantum probabilities**.
- These are collapsed into melodies using a **Quantum Melody DNA** seed system.
- Output is saved as a `.mid` file you can play in any music software.
